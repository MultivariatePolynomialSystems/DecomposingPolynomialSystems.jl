# Sampling Polynomial Systems

In this Julia package we deal with parametric polynomial systems with finitely many solutions for generic parameters. We use [`HomotopyContinuation.jl`](https://www.juliahomotopycontinuation.org/) to sample such polynomial systems.

## SampledSystem

`SampledSystem` is a struct type that initially contains a polynomial system, the result of monodromy computations, and the solutions-parameters samples obtained with [`run_monodromy`](@ref) or [`sample!`](@ref).
