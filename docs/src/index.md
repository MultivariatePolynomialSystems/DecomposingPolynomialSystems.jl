# Introduction
*DecomposingPolynomialSystems.jl is a Julia package for decomposing systems of polynomial equations, i.e. representing a possibly complicated polynomial system as a sequence of simpler polynomial subsystems.*

## Package Features
- Computing symmetries that fix the parameters of the polynomial system
- Computing invariants...
