# Symmetries

Some decompositions are caused by the presence of non-trivial symmetries of the polynomial system that are given by rational maps. There are 2 important types of symmetries. The 1st type is scaling symmetries, namely, the maps that act by scaling individual variables of the formuation. The 2nd type are deck transformations, namely, the birational maps that fix the parameters of the polynomial system.
